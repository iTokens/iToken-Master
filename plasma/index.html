		<p><b>Abstract:</b> Plasma is a proposed framework for
		incentivized and enforced execution of smart contracts which is
		scalable to a significant amount of state updates per second
		(potentially billions) enabling the blockchain to be able to
		represent a significant amount of decentralized financial
		applications worldwide. These smart contracts are incentivized
		to continue operation autonomously via network transaction
		fees, which is ultimately reliant upon the underlying
		blockchain (e.g. Ethereum) to enforce transactional state
		transitions.</p>

		<p>We propose a method for decentralized autonomous
		applications to scale to process not only financial activity,
		but also construct economic incentives for globally persistent
		data services, which may produce an alternative to centralized
		server farms.</p>

		<p>Plasma is composed of two key parts of the design: Reframing
		all blockchain computation into a set of MapReduce functions,
		and an optional method to do Proof-of-Stake token bonding on
		top of existing blockchains with the understanding that the
		Nakamoto Consensus incentives discourage block withholding.</p>

		<p>This construction is achieved by composing smart contracts
		on the main blockchain using fraud proofs whereby state
		transitions can be enforced on a parent blockchain. We compose
		blockchains into a tree hierarchy, and treat each as an
		individual branch blockchain with enforced blockchain history
		and MapReducable computation committed into merkle proofs. By
		framing one's ledger entry into a child blockchain which is
		enforced by the parent chain, one can enable incredible scale
		with minimized trust (presuming root blockchain availability
		and correctness).</p>

		<p>The greatest complexity around global enforcement of
		non-global data revolves around data availability and block
		withholding attacks, Plasma has mitigations for this issue by
		allowing for exiting faulty chains while also creating
		mechanisms to incentivize and enforce continued correct
		execution of data.</p>

		<p>As only merkleized commitments are broadcast periodically to
		the root blockchain (i.e. Ethereum) during non-faulty states,
		this can allow for incredibly scalable, low cost transactions
		and computation. Plasma enables persistently operating
		decentralized applications at high scale.</p>
