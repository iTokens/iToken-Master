# iToken-Master

iTokens - The Reverse Mining Cryptocurrency where total coin supply decreases because mining removes iToken coins. 

iTokens are removed by Proof of Stake Mining instead of current wasteful GPU Method utilized in Bitcoin and many other early blockchains. GPU Mining makes mining a massive electricity sink, and the majority of that energy is wasted because most of it is not used for making the network more secure, but is just there to reduce the number of coins mined.

Simply put, any iToken balance in your wallet address generates dividend-style returns, rewarding every holder with royalty payments every block for verifying network transactions by Auto-Mining. bringing returns based on amount of iTokens of each. 

### How are iTokens different from Bitcoins?

iTokens get removed every block, lowering the number of iTokens in circulation. This is the opposite of Bitcoin where mining generates new coins, growing total supply growing. iTokens are removed and staked automatically by a competitive and decentralized process called "Reverse-Mining". This process involves that individuals are rewarded by the network for their services. iToken Stakers are processing transactions and securing the network staking their existing iTokens and are collecting new iTokens in exchange. Furthermore, the iTokens Protocol is runs on top of the ERC Ethereum network, unlike Bitcoins.


### How do I get dividend payments from my iTokens?

The Auto-Mining feature will stake iTokens automatically, beginning around with Ethereum's Casper Update, at through Master Nodes (addresses with more then 100,000 iTokens) and small amounts through Staking Pools. Eventually we expect to implement staking with as low as 1 token.

### What are your plans for marketing?

Undertaking a proof of concept process, the best method prove and validate our Blockchain is through organic growth by bringing real value that benefits people using our cryptocurrency. 

Marketing efforts will be focused on is iTokens trading listed on multiple Exchanges, as well as Airdrops and custom made faucets that slowly give out iTokens without any strings attached. Our ideal Initial Coin Offering is be giving away all the coins completley free 1 coin at a time to every person that wants one, except that is not possible in a fair way yet due to pricy Gas prices for ICO Volume transactions.

Furthermore, we believe in a lean Organization principles, the iToken Team currently consisting of just 6 Dedicated Developers, supplemented by Open Source contributors.

### When do iTokens start getting removed?

Staking and Reverse-Mining will begin with Ethereum's Casper update, until then no iTokens burned, with a test supply initially being burned at an initial test period.


### How much will I earn from dividends by holding iTokens?

The dividend return on staking iTokens is effected by a variety of factors. More iTokens held on an address will result in more iTokens automatically paid through dividends to that mining every block. Other factors such as the amount of time you have held your tokens for, an element of chance as it is randomized, your address's network usage, block mining time, amount of transactions, and network difficulty will vary the rate of return and we do not have concrete details at this time. Staking iTokens is risky because there is a chance of coin loss, which pays for the potential of high stake winnings. 

We do not have definite numbers yet, but returns are meant to be more competitive than Ethereum or other Proof of Stake examples due to higher risk of net loss during staking iTokens.


### If iTokens are removed every block and none are added, will I ever loose any of my iTokens?

Rest assured, as an example if you have 100 iToken that you don't stake for dividend profit, at current network difficulty it would take until 2020 for your balance to decay down to to 99. iTokens' Proof of Stake implementation creates risk when staking, and you may a fraction of your coins over time. This creates a large return but also creates risk of net loss from staking. Accounts that have iTokens they decide not to stake, also contribute to burning coins by paying for a length of time not to stake.

Net dividends are also based on things like your balance amount, how long you held your balance, and network usage.


## Frequently Asked Questions


## What makes iTokens different?

Simply put, iTokens are a cryptocurrency with an ever-decreasing coin supply, iTokens are deleted through mining instead of added, making each iToken left more valuable. Any iToken balance in your wallet address generates dividend-style returns, rewarding every holder with royalty payments every block for verifying network transactions by Auto-Mining. iToken's implementation of competitive staking is different than the traditional concept, the risk of loosing iTokens to other users creates a much more competitive staking environment.

### Were any iTokens premined?

Instead of premining, the only way iTokens are able to be generated during the crowdsale by locking Ethereum through a transaction, and the 5% of iTokens to be distributed between the team of 6 Developers and 4 Engineers on the iToken Team is through the same process, paying the same price as the public from the ICO for fairness. iTokens are only able to be removed and not added, all iTokens in existance were generated through a Public Initial Coin Offering.

### Will the amount of iTokens ever go down to 0?

Technically possible, but only after years with high network difficulty. If the total amount of iTokens ever does become too low (less than %50), a protocol to double all iTokens holders balances addresses, bringing it back to the initial supply without inflating value held by holders.


### How is iToken Development funded? Can I earn iTokens for fixing bugs or adding features?

25% of iTokens are publically locked as a Long-Term Development Fund in order to pay future Development efforts, giveaways, faucets, airdrops, testing, and marketing efforts. None of these funds will be available for the existing Development team, and are distributed via public Smart-Contract based voting. The majority of the Long-Term Development Fund (20%) is to provide a major incentive for Open-Source Source Code Contributions & Bug Finding Rewards from the Public on Github. Open Source Developers are paid automatically in iTokens through a Smart Contract, as bounties for issues and roadmap items.


### Which other cryptocurrencies use Proof-of-Stake?

Proof of Stake is already used in cryptocurrencies such as ZCash, Komodo, Monero, and Dash, while the Plasma Chain was recently announced as the underlying architecture behind OmiseGO (Ticker:OMG). Bitcoin will convert to implement POS some time in the future, with long-term Development plans and concrete roadmap on the Main Development Branch by Bitcoin Foundation, with Ethereum in the process of converting from GPU Mining to a full POS model as well.

### How many iTokens will I need to run a Master Node?

Masternodes require a minimum 100,000 iTokens to qualify for independent Proof-of-Stake mining, but pools are avaliable as well. Future development plans include Auto-Staking any balance across the network.

### Which other coins are planning to use Ethereum's Plasma Chain?

OmiseGo or OMG network will be a Plasma chain that uses Ethereum as its root chain. Vitalik has called it an Ethereum sidechain several times but Joseph is adamant that that's not the right way to look at it. While we get the vocabulary sorted out, see https://plasma.io to understand what the vocabulary refers to. Alternately, this reddit comment provides a decent summary: https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/6sqca5/plasma_scalable_autonomous_smart_contracts/dleskw5/


### What's the best way to earn iTokens?

Software Developers contributing to iTokens Github are rewarded iTokens for each successful contribution through our Development Fund. The payouts are quite generous, and being that this fund is 1/5th of the initial suuply, it's goal is to incentivize organic development base by heavily rewarding good Developers who add value to the project.
